Train-Reservation-System<br>

Tech Stacks:<br>
C++,
Multi-Threading,
Mutex,
Semaphores<br>
Description<br>
This is a concurrency (Process Synchronization) project under the field of Operating Systems. The project exploits multithreading to achieve concurrency in real-life ticket booking systems. The approach taken to solve the synchronization problem is similar to the Reader-Writer Problem.<br>

Note: One must use C++17 or beyond to run the code.<br>

Features:<br>
1)Simulates a train reservation system with concurrent access.<br>
2)Ensures data consistency and prevents race conditions using mutexes and semaphores.<br>
3)Demonstrates the use of multi-threading to handle multiple ticket booking requests simultaneously.<br>
Requirements:<br>
C++17 or later
